K12,K12 Student,Homeless,Homeless Unaccompanied Youth Status,"A homeless unaccompanied youth is a youth who is not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian and who fits the McKinney-Vento definition of homeless.  Students must be both unaccompanied and homeless to be included as unaccompanied homeless youth. There is no age range specified for an unaccompanied youth in the law. The upper age range is determined by what a state defines as school age, unless the child is in special education. The upper age range for students in special education may extend to 22 years of age. There is no lower age range. Therefore, as an example, a young child not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian, though living with a caregiver, and is living in a situation that is not fixed, regular, and adequate, would be identified as a homeless unaccompanied youth.","Yes
